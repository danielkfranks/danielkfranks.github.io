		<h1> Daniel's Webpage </h1>
		<p>
			Hi, I'm Daniel! I'm a student of computer science and electrical engineering (you can learn more in my <a href="./about.html">About Me</a>) but I'm pretty much always looking to learn something new and build something new. From web development to embedded systems to industrial electrical work, I jump at every opportunity to expand my horizons and increase my range of perspectives.
		</p>
		<h2> Personal Philosophy </h2>
		<p>
			Problem solving is a deep, layered task; and I live to better understand and complete that task. Dr. Michael D. Wilder, Ph.D, explained one aspect well when he said "In order to write good software, you have to understand good hardware." I took that quote to heart and ran with it, but I expanded it beyond just the problem set of programming. There are many problems in the world, from the project at hand to broad issues like global warming and social division. I believe that any attempt to solve those problems from one specific point of view will only make the situation worse. Rather, such issues require a diverse worldview to approach with any meaning; and thus, to maximize my problem-solving capacity, I always aim to diversify my worldview.
		</p>
		<h2> Practical Application </h2>
		<p>
			So, how do I go about this? By jumping at every opportunity I see. My original DNA is computer science, and if someone asks my title I'll say that to simplify matters, but I do far more than computer science. For starters, I'm taking three seperate college degrees: computer science, cybersecurity, and mathematics. That seemed a little flat to me, so I added in a certificate in business entreprenurship - I don't necessarily plan on opening a freelance business (although I could) but rather to understand the business mindset. This allows me to better communicate with businesspeople, since I understand their priorities and concerns and can address those in my software development. Further, I add perspective from industrial automation and automotive maintainance to be able to approach an even wider set of problems with mindsets and analogies that enable me to handle a wide variety of problems.
		</p>
		<h2> Looking Forwards </h2>
		<p>
			But, am I resting on my laurels? Not in a thousand years. I know enough to know I didn't get here without trying, and I'm not getting any further without trying either. I'm always looking for new opportunities and new projects that allow me to spread my horizons broader and do more with my life. I have no idea where life will lead me next, but I'm always excited for it. Even when something harsh happens, I do my best to realize that it's a new problem that I can use to broaden my problem-solving horizons. I can also recognize my blessings there, in that I'm always blessed in working my way out of lousy circumstances. This gives me a mindset that enjoys risk, because I know that the worst-case scenario isn't truly that bad.
		</p>
		<h2> What's today? </h2>
		<p>
			Grand talk is all well and good, but it doesn't get anywhere without doing something <em>today</em>. Right now, I'm working (actively) on finding an internship over the summer, as well as taking classes towards all three of my majors and keeping up on mechanically fixing my Jeep and bicycles. So, what about you? What keeps you busy making yourself a better person and the world a better place? How do you fight against the constant entropy of the universe? If you have anything you think I'd like to hear, you can direct it to me at <a href="mailto:danielkfranks@gmail.com">my email address</a>. I look forward to hearing from you!
