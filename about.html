		<h1>Hi!</h1>

		<p>
			I'm Daniel Franks, a student of computer science, cybersecurity, and mathematics at the University of Idaho. In my spare time, I like to write recreational programs, ride my bicycle, and drive my 1992 Jeep Cherokee as Lee Iacocca intended. I believe firmly that computers are a powerful tool to solve many of the world's problems, but I believe human happiness isn't one of those problems.
		</p>
		<p>
			Now that you have an introduction to me, I'd like to dive a bit deeper into specific elements of how I work. We can start with tooling. A crazy old electrician once told me that using the wrong tool for the job is setting yourself up for failure, and I believe him. I tend towards the most capable tools I can find, and then realize that I'll just have to gradually figure them out. A good example would be the Vim text editor. Would it be faster for me to develop in VSCode? More than likely, and sometimes I need that speed and I'll switch to VSCode. But, by and large, I want to learn how to use the ultimately more powerful tool, in the hopes that it'll pay off someday.
		</p>
		<p>
			The root behavior behind this is the notion of <em>delayed gratification</em>, something that I view as very important in my life and education. Sacrifices now will pay off later. This is why I take the classes I take and drive the car I drive, but more importantly, this is why people ultimately do hard things. Hard things suck. But, someday, we'll need to do harder things, and we'll thank our lucky stars that we did the hard things back then. Sure, you can turn and run, but you can only run so far before life catches up to you - and I don't want to spend my life on the run.
		</p>
		<p>
			Now, for something completely different. What can I do? Well, as you might have guessed, my primary skill sets lie in computer science. I've taken a variety of important classes, including Databases, Analysis of Algorithms, Data Structures, and Programming Languages. I'm comfortable with Linux and in fact enjoy Bash scripting. Naturally, due to the breadth of my education, I have a variety of other skills, such as mathematical analys, cybersecurity risk analysis, and electrical design and implementation; all to varying degrees of proficiency. However, I believe my most valuable skill is my speed and agility of learning. Given a new tool, a sense of direction, good documentation and time for experimentation, I can learn that tool very quickly. I like to cite my experience with ladder logic here: Ladder logic is a "programming language" that intends to be simple for journeyman electricians to use. It's built around relay based logic, which is not dissimilar to transistor logic but still has its quirks. It bears little to no resemblance to the experience I had prior to encountering ladder logic, which was Python and gate logic. My boss gave me a project to work on in my spare time, which was a simple stoplight controller. It took me about a week to learn ladder logic and develop that stoplight controller. After about a month,I figure I was on par with the more experienced programmers there. I have no doubt that I could do that again with a new toolset or technology, and I'd enjoy doing it.
