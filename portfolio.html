		<h1>Portfolio</h1>
		<p>
			So, where is it? My portfolio is threadbare, and I'm ashamed of it, but it's for a good reason. With my academic load (three degrees and all) I don't have time for much recreational code. I could upload my academic code - and often do - but, due to intellectual property concerns (read: other students finding my old homework assignments and using them to cheat) that's kept in private repositories. If you'd like to take a look, you can <a href="./contact.html">contact</a> me, but it's also not particularly well maintained. I have many things to do, and uploading school assignments to private repositories is somewhere below ironing my own clothes.

			Anyway, here's my <a href="github.com/danielkfranks">Github</a>, where you can find a couple scripts I've thrown together.

			Now, not all my work is purely academic. As much as I'd like to show off the electrical messes I've untangled, that's not exactly feasible. However, I can show you my main extracirricular project, my 1992 Jeep Cherokee. This car was purchased with the intent of learning auto maintainance, and it's served its purpose well. Most of my upgrades have been (unsuprisingly) of an electrical nature, such as decommissioning the original and inadequate headlight wiring and replacing it with a custom relay-based wiring harness that allows for much improved performance from my Koito H4 headlights. However, I've done more than just electrical work. Jeep upgraded the brake system on the Cherokee in 1995, and due to safety concerns I chose to follow suit, replacing the brake master with a custom setup based on a 1997 Grand Cherokee and rebuilding the brakes at all four corners. This coincided well with a replacement of the rear axle (the original one was poorly maintained when I got it) and a conversion of the front system to a Core 4x4 system that, among other things, takes care of the death wobble that Jeeps of this vintage are famous for. I have also done significant restoration work to the interior and cooling system, and plan on eventually restoring this vehicle to its original status as <em>the</em> luxury offroad SUV.
